# 3_RF_Project (draft)



# Overview

Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, focusing on data analyst roles. This project was the result of taking the **Python for Data Analytics** created by [Luke Barousse](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-b) and [Kelly Adams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellyjianadams). The objective is to navigate and understand the job market for data positions more effectively. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

The data was sourced from [Luke Barousse's Python Course](https://lukebarousse.com/python), which provides a foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.

# The Questions

Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:

1. What are the skills most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?
2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
4. What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying) 

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **Python:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights.I also used the following Python libraries:
    - **Pandas Library:** This was used to analyze the data. 
    - **Matplotlib Library:** I visualized the data.
    - **Seaborn Library:** Helped me create more advanced visuals. 
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for executing my Python scripts.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

## Import & Clean Up Data

I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

## Filter US Jobs

To focus my analysis on the U.S. job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the United States.

```python
df_US = df[df['job_country'] == 'United States']

```

# The Analysis

Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [2_Skills_Demand](2_Skills_demand.ipynb).

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax =plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)

# Now we're going to iterate through the list of job titles to plot each one of them
for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    sns.set_theme('paper')
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')
    ax[i].set_title(job_title)
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlabel('')
    ax[i].get_legend().remove()
    ax[i].set_xlim(0,78)

    # Cycling through the index (n) and value (v) - Adding the percentage next to each bar
    for n, v in enumerate(df_plot['skill_percent']):
       # Explanation of the .text(x, y, value, va) | # We're using v+1 so that the number is not too close to the bar 
       # va='center' is to align the number vertically with the bar | To get the percentage in a presentable way, we're using the f string to clean it up
       # .0f means we're getting the floating point but without the decimals, it rounds it for us.     
       ax[i].text(v+1, n, f'{v:.0f}%', va='center') 

    # We want to only show the x-axis intervals in the bottom graph, so we're using an if statement to remove it from the top 2 graps
    if i != len(job_titles) - 1:
        ax[i].set_xticks([])


fig.suptitle('Likelihood of skills Requested in US Job Postings', fontsize=15)
plt.tight_layout(h_pad=0.5) #fix the overlap
plt.show()
```

### Results

![Likelihood of Skills Requested in the US Job Postings](RF_images/likelihood_skills_US_data_jobs_2023.png)

*Bar graph visualizing the salary for the top 3 data roles and their top 5 skills associated with each.*

### Insights:

- **SQL** is the most requested skill for Data Analysts and Data Scientists, with it in over half the job postings for both roles. For Data Engineers, Python is the most sought-after skill, appearing in 68% of job postings.
- **Data Engineers** require more specialized technical skills (AWS, Azure, Spark) compared to Data Analysts and Data Scientists who are expected to be proficient in more general data management and analysis tools (Excel, Tableau).
- **Python** is a versatile skill, highly demanded across all three roles, but most prominently for Data Scientists (72%) and Data Engineers (65%).

## 2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?

To find how skills are trending in 2023 for Data Analysts, I filtered data analyst positions and grouped the skills by the month of the job postings. This got me the top 5 skills of data analysts by month, showing how popular skills were throughout 2023.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [3_Skills_Trend](3_Skills_Trend.ipynb).

### Visualize Data
```python
# For the plotting, we only want the first rows (I've chosen 7 columns because Power BI is in 7th place and I find it relevant it include it). 

# For this we're going to use the .iloc method 
#  .iloc[:, :no_of_colums] -> means all rows, but only the number of columns I specify in the no_of_columns variable
nno_of_colums = 7
df_plot = df_DA_US_percent.iloc[:, :no_of_colums]

sns.lineplot(data=df_plot, dashes=False, palette='tab10')
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.despine()

plt.title('Trending Top Skills for Data Analysis in the US')
plt.ylabel('Likelihood in Job Posting')
plt.xlabel('2023')
plt.legend().remove()

# To format the y-axis with percentage
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter
ax = plt.gca()
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0)) 

# To add the text to the lines, adjusting them to avoid overlap
from adjustText import adjust_text
texts = []
for i in range(no_of_colums):
    texts.append(
        plt.text(11.2, df_plot.iloc[-1, i], df_plot.columns[i])
    )
adjust_text(texts, arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='gray'))

plt.show()

```

### Results

![Trending Top Skills for Data Analysts in the US](RF_images/In-demand_skills.png)  
*Bar graph visualizing the trending top skills for data analysts in the US in 2023.*

### Insights:
- **SQL** remains the most consistently demanded skill throughout the year, although it shows a gradual decrease in demand.
- **Excel** experienced a significant increase in demand starting around September, surpassing both Python and Tableau by the end of the year.
- Both **Python** and **Tableau** show relatively stable demand throughout the year with some fluctuations but remain essential skills for data analysts. Power BI, while less demanded compared to the others, shows a slight upward trend towards the year's end.

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?

To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only got jobs in the United States and looked at their median salary. But first I looked at the salary distributions of common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_Salary_Analysis](4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb).

#### Visualize Data 

```python
# Plotting with seaborn
sns.boxplot(data=df_US_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=job_order)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

plt.title('Salary Distributions in the United States')
plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary (USD)')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.xlim(0, 600_000)
ticks_x = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()

```

#### Results

![Salary Distributions of Data Jobs in the US](RF_images/salary_boxplot.png)  
*Box plot visualizing the salary distributions for the top 6 data job titles.*

#### Insights

- There's a significant variation in salary ranges across different job titles. Senior Data Scientist positions tend to have the highest salary potential, with up to $600K, indicating the high value placed on advanced data skills and experience in the industry.

- Senior Data Engineer and Senior Data Scientist roles show a considerable number of outliers on the higher end of the salary spectrum, suggesting that exceptional skills or circumstances can lead to high pay in these roles. In contrast, Data Analyst roles demonstrate more consistency in salary, with fewer outliers.

- The median salaries increase with the seniority and specialization of the roles. Senior roles (Senior Data Scientist, Senior Data Engineer) not only have higher median salaries but also larger differences in typical salaries, reflecting greater variance in compensation as responsibilities increase.

### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts

Next, I narrowed my analysis and focused only on **data analyst** roles. I looked at the highest-paid skills and the most in-demand skills. I used two bar charts to showcase these.

#### Visualize Data

```python

# Plotting
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2,1)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
# Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts

sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median', y=df_DA_top_pay.index, ax=ax[0], hue='median', palette='dark:b_r') #the _r in the palette parameter reverts the colour
ax[0].legend().remove()
# df_DA_top_pay[::-1].plot(kind='barh', y='median', ax=ax[0], legend=False)
ax[0].set_title('Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts')
ax[0].set_xlabel('')
ax[0].set_ylabel('')
ax[0].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

# Top 10 Most in Demand Skills for Data Analysts

sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, ax=ax[1], hue='median', palette='light:b')
ax[1].legend().remove()
# df_DA_skills[::-1].plot(kind='barh', y='median', ax=ax[1], legend=False)
ax[1].set_title('Top 10 Most in Demand Skills for Data Analysts')
ax[1].set_xlabel('Median Salary (USD)')
ax[1].set_ylabel('')
ax[1].set_xlim(ax[0].get_xlim()) #set the same x-axis limits as the first plot
ax[1].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

#### Results
Here's the breakdown of the highest-paid & most in-demand skills for data analysts in the US:

![The Highest Paid & Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts in the US](RF_images/highest_paid_most_demand.png)
*Two separate bar graphs visualizing the highest paid skills and most in-demand skills for data analysts in the US.*

#### Insights:

- The top graph shows specialized technical skills like `dplyr`, `Bitbucket`, and `Gitlab` are associated with higher salaries, some reaching up to $200K, suggesting that advanced technical proficiency can increase earning potential.

- The bottom graph highlights that foundational skills like `Excel`, `PowerPoint`, and `SQL` are among the most in-demand, even though they may not offer the highest salaries. This demonstrates the importance of these core skills for employability in data analysis roles.

- There's a clear distinction between the skills that are highest paid and those that are most in-demand. **Data analysts aiming to maximize their career potential should consider developing a diverse skill set that includes both high-paying specialized skills and widely demanded foundational skills**.

## 4. What are the most optimal skills to learn for Data Analysts?

To identify the most optimal skills to learn ( the ones that are the highest paid and highest in demand) I calculated the percent of skill demand and the median salary of these skills. To easily identify which are the most optimal skills to learn. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [5_Optimal_Skills](5_Optimal_Skills.ipynb).

#### Visualize Data

```python
from adjustText import adjust_text

plt.scatter(df_DA_skills_high_demand['skill_percent'], df_DA_skills_high_demand['median_salary'])
plt.xlabel('Percent of Data Analyst Jobs')
plt.ylabel('Median Salary ($USD)')  # Assuming this is the label you want for y-axis
plt.title('Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in the US')

# Get current axes, set limits, and format axes
ax = plt.gca() #gca -> Get Current Axis
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K'))  # Example formatting y-axis
# Import the Percent Formatter from matplotlib.ticket
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))

# Add labels to points and collect them in a list
texts = []
for i, txt in enumerate(df_DA_skills_high_demand.index):
    texts.append(plt.text(df_DA_skills_high_demand['skill_percent'].iloc[i], df_DA_skills_high_demand['median_salary'].iloc[i], " " + txt))

# Adjust text to avoid overlap and add arrows
adjust_text(texts, arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='gray'))

plt.show()
```

#### Results

![Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in the US](RF_images/Most_Optimal_Skills_for_Data_Analysts_in_the_US.png)    
*A scatter plot visualizing the most optimal skills (high paying & high demand) for data analysts in the US.*

#### Insights:

- The skill `Oracle` appears to have the highest median salary of nearly $97K, despite being less common in job postings. This suggests a high value placed on specialized database skills within the data analyst profession.

- More commonly required skills like `Excel` and `SQL` have a large presence in job listings but lower median salaries compared to specialized skills like `Python` and `Tableau`, which not only have higher salaries but are also moderately prevalent in job listings.

- Skills such as `Python`, `Tableau`, and `SQL Server` are towards the higher end of the salary spectrum while also being fairly common in job listings, indicating that proficiency in these tools can lead to good opportunities in data analytics.

### Visualizing Different Techonologies

Let's visualize the different technologies as well in the graph. We'll add color labels based on the technology (e.g., {Programming: Python})

#### Visualize Data

```python
# So, now, we have the Data Frame that we need to plot! (we're re-using the previous code and improving on it)

from adjustText import adjust_text # we're importing the adjust_text to prevent overlap on the words 

sns.scatterplot(
    data=df_plot,
    x='skill_percent',
    y='median_salary',
    hue='technology'
)

sns.despine() #removing the border around the chart
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

# Prepare texts for adjustText, using df_plot for both coordinates and labels
texts = []
for i, row in df_plot.iterrows():
    texts.append(
        plt.text(row['skill_percent'], row['median_salary'], " " + str(row['skills']))
    )

# Adjust text to avoid overlap
adjust_text(
    texts,
    arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='gray'),
    expand_text=(1.2, 1.4),
    expand_points=(1.2, 1.4),
    force_text=0.5,
    force_points=0.5,
    verbose=False #removes some unecessary debug output
)

# Set axis labels, title, and legend
plt.xlabel('Percent of Data Analyst Jobs')
plt.ylabel('Median Yearly Salary')
plt.title('Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in the US')
plt.legend(title='Technology')

from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter
ax = plt.gca()
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K'))
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))

# Adjust layout and display plot 
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```
